Get Started in Three Simple Steps:

Step 1 – Choose a Photo: Pick the best photo from Instagram, Facebook, your computer, or camera roll and upload it with your order.
Step 2 – Customize Your Portrait: We want to know your tastes! Choose the portraits background color. And as an optional bonus, we will print your name on the portrait.
Step 3 - Custom Design and Illustration: Sit tight while our designers create your masterpiece. Most orders will be delivered within 1-3 usually sooner.


Image Guidelines:

-A photo that was taken in the daylight or in a well-lit room, with a smartphone or good quality camera.
-The face & neck are visible
-Photos should be without filters; your original coloring is important to us.
-We prefer having people look directly at the camera at eye level, facing forward. Other positions are acceptable, keep in mind you will be shown in that position in the final portrait.
-Be aware of accessories: all accessories will be illustrated in your final portrait. In some cases we can try to remove these, just be sure to make note of that in your order notes when checking out.


Memorials:

We have a lot of customers reach out to us for memorial requests, so we understand you may not be able to meet our image guidelines, and that is okay we will do our best to make any photo work.


IMPORTANT:

This is Digital File only. This custom portrait is sent to you by email, so that you can print it out at home or at your local print shop. This will save you time and money, rather than having it shipped. Meaning no shipping time, shipping cost, and risk of damage.
The Custom Portrait will be completed within 1-3 days (this time may change depending on the number of orders received)
You will receive a High Quality File in JPEG and PSD


HOLIDAY SEASON NOTE:

During the holiday season I usually get a lot of orders and will usually have a waiting list of custom portraits to complete. Expect an average order time of 2-3x normal before I can complete your custom portrait.
